# Background

While [building the spectroscope]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-09-22-Building-a-digital-spectroscope-from-scratch %}) i noticed when handling the diffraction grating that any fingerprints on it were really visible and couldn't be removed anymore. I suspected that this was because some of the substances on my fingers got into the 'grating' and was distorting the refraction of light. As I recently bought a microscope and had lots of grating left, I decided to look in detail at the sheet and see if i could discern the slits of one thousandth the size of a millimeter, and if there was any noticeable difference between the dirty and clean grating. In direct light nothing was observable. I decided to cover up part of the light at the bottom, which resulted in a clear difference! With the light hitting the grating at a bit of an angle but below the refraction index, the dirty grating unveiled some straight lines, while the clean one had a clean shine across its' entirety. Covering a larger part of the microscope light meant a larger angle of incidence, and here the difference is observable even more beautifully!
