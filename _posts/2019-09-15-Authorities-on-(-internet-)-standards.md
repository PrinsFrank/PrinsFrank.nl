Sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the authorities, so I decided to make an overview. Mostly for my own sake, but why not share it? This is a very short list for now, as these are only the standards i am working with right now. My intention is to make this a living document so I will update this whenever i come across a new authority or standard, or when something changes.

| [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) | [HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231) |
