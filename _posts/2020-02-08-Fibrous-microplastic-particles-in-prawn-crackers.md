Even though I had the intention to write more here this year, I haven't done that so far because i was busy researching microplastics in prawn crackers and writing up the paper. It's finally done though, you can read it [on github](https://github.com/PrinsFrank/PrinsFrank.nl/blob/master/papers/2020-02-08-fibrous-microplastic-particles-in-prawn-crackers.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} or download it directly as a [pdf](https://github.com/PrinsFrank/PrinsFrank.nl/raw/master/papers/2020-02-08-fibrous-microplastic-particles-in-prawn-crackers.pdf

It was fun to finally put my microscope to good use. Collecting all the necessary equipment like a vacuum attachment and glassware was really fun as well, although the entire project got a little more expensive than I hoped for. Part of the reason I decided to look into prawn crackers was because of how cheap I thought I could run the project, but the surprises like 60 euro filter paper and a really expensive vacuum erlenmeyer were not expected.

This is not the last of me experimenting with microplastics though. A really interesting technique of [staining plastics with fluorescent Nile Red](https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10026.1/10621/Lost%2C%20but%20found%20with%20Nile%20red.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is something I definitely want to look into, but that involves some new UV equipment and light filters. I will keep you guys updated about the progress! As I live very close to the beach, I am also designing a long term study into the presence of microplastics on the shore. I will start working on that when i have the UV staining set up!
