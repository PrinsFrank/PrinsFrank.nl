It's been three months since I'm back from my trip to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. And while there are as many Soviet buildings, beautiful sights, mountain backdrops, and amazing sleeper trains as you might expect, I won't write about them here as you'll find all about them on other pages on the internet.

No, today I've decided to finally share the interesting transition I watched while I was in Almaty, Kazakhstan. This city that was on my way from Bishkek to Astana and back, has quickly become one of my favorite cities in Central Asia - although second to Bishkek.

On a cold day I decided to walk to the Ascension Cathedral in the center of Bishkek, when a building caught my eyes. After weeks of Plov, Manti, Laghman, Samsa and all different kind of central Asian dishes, the recognizable wooden construction and shapes combined with the green accent colors sparked some kind of recognition and longing for Western food. Food that was as unhealthy as all the food I'd eaten until then, but somehow would be a relief for my stomach. Even without the golden arches above the door this building was undoubtedly at one point a McDonald's, but was now stripped of its labels. Apart from a shape that was eerily familiar - covered by a tarp.

Once inside, the familiarity didn't stop there, but there was no branding in sight. The only text that looked like some kind of branding said "We are open". An order counter was empty;

Menus were covered with generic names. "Chicken taste", "Chicken Classic", "Meat Deluxe", "Delicious Potatoes" were some of the menu options.

Even table service was available here!

As my curiosity was piqued - and to treat my stomach to some other food - I had to order some food here. I went for "Delicious Potatoes", a cola and a "Meat Deluxe".

The name on Google Maps for this place: "TOO «Food Solutions KZ»"

Of course I wanted to know more, so I looked around on news sites looking for some kind of back story to this nameless restaurant. I found a [Reuters article with pictures of this exact restaurant, titled "Former McDonald's restaurants reopen without branding in Kazakhstan"](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/former-mcdonalds-restaurants-reopen-without-branding-kazakhstan-2023-01-23/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. The reason for this interesting place according to that article: 

> McDonald's and Food Solutions KZ terminated their license agreement this month, citing supply issues.
> Sources earlier told Reuters that McDonald's Kazakhstan had stopped buying supplies from Russia and had trouble replacing them.

That would have been it if the timing on my visit to this city wouldn't have been perfect. Because after I stepped on a train to Astana later that day, I would have to travel back through this city on my way back.

And to my surprise, new branding did appear! The new name: "I'm", with as subbranding "feel-good restaurants".

I wouldn't post here without this interesting turn of events, so of course I had to take some more pictures inside. (Note the notice of missing license key for windows on the bottom right corner of the self-service kiosk).

And when in Rome...

Would you realise you weren't at a McDonalds when you passed this restaurant?
