When i first started this site I had the intention to leave out my name and write anonymously. Halfway through setting it up i decide to include my name anyway. With my last posts not mainly about vulnerabilities or ethical hacking but more about general subjects it doesn't make sense to stay at the previous domain name.

Services were down for 20 something minutes, but are now fully operational again. Redirects are in place for all paths, but some RSS readers may not like 301s on RSS feeds. In the next couple of days https will be enabled and enforced again as Github pages doesn't provide ssl certificates very fast or any way to pre-request them before domain transfer.

Do you see anything that's not right? let me know! my email is still available at the same address for the previous domain name and can be found below.
