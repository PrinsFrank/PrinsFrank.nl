**_Again?_ This one word might be said too much by your users, customer support staff or developers and can say a lot about the quality of your bug fixes. Or you are just looking for a framework to guide your efforts in squashing bugs. Either way, you came to the right place!**

When working on a highly volatile application, changes happen quickly and often. Especially when working with a lot of people and an ever-growing application, that usually means that things break in the process; Bugs. 

> The A.G.A.I.N.‽ acronym was chosen to represent the 5 levels of bugfixing. The word "AGAIN" was chosen as a mnemonic device similar to "SOLID" and "KISS". Letters are seperated by a dot(.) and the acronym is closed by an interrobang(‽) to indicate inevitable frustration.

How easy it is to solve a bug differs per type of environment, but generally bugs cost a lot of money. The initial thought about bug costs might be about finding, reporting, debugging and fixing the bug. But a developer that is working on that debugging and fixing is also not working on other projects - the cost of opportunity. Add to that the time for context switching, costs for extra support staff, project managements for bug organization, loss of customers and productivity lost , the direct bug fixing effort is just the tip of the iceberg.

Typically, A bug is an annoyance to Developers. They just want to crack on building that shiny new feature they have been working on. And when the actionable bug is fixed, that's it. Once a project gets bigger, the amount of bugs generally increases though, and with the age of a product usually the percentage of time spent on fixing these bugs also increases. Instead of just fixing the bugs, it makes sense to more structurally approach resolving defects, which is covered by this framework.

/** TODO


## **A**ctionable Bug

Solving the _Actionable Bug_ is usually the only step in the framework consistently taken to resolve an issue. Here it is the first of five.

## **G**lobal Occurences

## **A**nalysis & Visibility

## **I**nsights

## **N**vironmental
